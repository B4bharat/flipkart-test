   * - search bar will always be on top, with 'show selected'
   * - Find how to insert an element into the DOM
   *  - create a function which attaches a node to the DOM based on the value
   *  - it should always be of the format <div><select></select><div class="key"></div><div class="value"></div><div class="description"></div></div>
   * - On entering search string, show only those params whose label matches the search string (or a subset of it)

   * - On clicking the Done button, print the final payload to the console
   *  - fetching the values of 'value field' nodes which are selected, formatting and printing to console
